			<h2>The Sun: The Heart Of Our Solar System</h2>
			<article>
				<img src="image/mercury.jpeg" alt="The Planet Mercury">
				<p>The solar system is our home in the Universe, a vast and dynamic
				region region of space filled with fascinating celestial objects
				At its heart lies the Sun, a star that provides light heat, and
				energy to sustain life on Earth. Orbiting the Sun are Planets,
				moons, asteroids, comets, and other mysterious bodies, each with
				its unqiue story to tell.</p>
				<p>The Sun is a giant, glowing ball of hot gas at the center of
		our solar system. It is the most important source of energy for life on Earth
		and influences everything in the solar system through its immense gravitational
		pull and radiant energy</p>
				<p>The Sun is an enromus sphere, with a diamter of 1.39 million kilometers
			or 864,000 miles making it 109 time wider than Earth. It is so massive that
			it contains 99.8% of the total mas of the solar system. The Sun is made up
			primarly of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of other elements.</p>

			<p>The Sun has several layers each with unique properties. The central region
			where temperatures reach 15 million&#176;C or 27 million&#176;F.
			Here, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen into helium, producing immense energy. Surronding 
			the outer layrer of the SUn's interior, where hot gases rise and cooler gases sink, creating
			convection current. The Sun's visible surface, where tempertaure are about 5,500&#176;C 
			or 9,932&#176;F. This is where sunlight is emitted. A think, reddish layer just above the
			photsphere, viisble during a solar ecplise. The Sun's outer atmostphere, extending millions of kilometers
			into space, and appearing as a glowing halo during exlipse. </p>
			<p>The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core. This process converts hydrogen
			into helium, releasing vast amounts of heat and light. The energy created in the Sun takes about
			170,000 years to travel from the core to the surface and only 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach
			earth.</p>
			<p>The Sun's gravitional pull keeps all the planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies
			in orbit. Its energy drives weather patterns climates and the water cycle on Earth, making life possible.
			The Sun's solar wind, a stream of charge particles, shapes planetary magnetic fields, and causes phenomena
			lke the Northern Lights.</p>
			<p>The Sun in about 4.6 billion years old and is considered a main sequence star. It has been stable for
			most of its life. It is expected to burn hydorgen in its core for another 5 billion years, before becoming a 
			red giant, then a white dwarf over billions more years.</p>

				<p> Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, called an exospehere, made up of
				oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Because the atmoshpere is so 
				thin, it doesn't provide prottection from solar radiation or meteor impacts.</p>
				<p>Mercruy is one of the two plaets in the solar system along with Venus that has
				no moon or rings.</p>
				<h2>Mercury has been visted by two spacecraft:</h2>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Mariner 10</strong>(1974-1975): The first spacecraft to fly by Mercury, capturing images of its surface.</li>
				<li><strong>Messenger</strong>(2004-2015): Orbited Mercury, providing deatailed data about its composition, surface, and magnaetic field.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Mercury Magnetic Field</h2>
				<p> Despite its small size, Mercury has a magnetic field which 
				is about 1% as strong as Earth's. Scientists beliwve the magnetic
				field is generated by partially liquid core.</p>

		<h2>Mercury: The Smallest Planet in the Solar System</h2>
		<img src="image/mercury.jpeg" alt= "The Planet Mercury">
		<p>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the
		smallest planet in our solar system. Despite its proximity
		to the Sun, it holds many fascinating mysteries.</p>
		<p>Mercury has a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers or 3,032 miles,
		making it slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</p>
		<p>It has a large, iron rich core that takes up about 
		85% of is interior, contributing to its high density. </p>
		<p>Due to its size and composition, Mercury is classified as a 
		<strong>terrestrial planet</strong>.</p>
		<p>Mercury is the fastest planet, completing an orbit
		around the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Its rotation is very
		slow; one day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days. Mercury has a 
		highly elliptical orbit, meaning its distance from the Sun
		varies significanlty.</p>
		<img src="image/calorisbasin.jpg" alt="The Caloris Basin">
		<p>Mercury's surface is heavily cratered ad resembels the Moon, with
		large basins and impact scars from ancient asteroid collisions. The largest
		impact crater is the Caloris Basin, spanning about 1,550 kilometers or 960 miles.
		Its surface experiences extreme temperatures, ranging from 930&#176;C or 800&#176;F
		during the day to -180&#176;C or -290&#176;F at night.</p>

			<h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>A day on Mercury is twice as long as its year</li>
			<img src="image/mercuryday.jpeg" alt="Mercury's day">
			<li>Mercury's lack of atmosphere means the sky
			is always black, even during the day</li>
			<img src="image/mercuryatmosphere.png" alt= "Mercury's Atmosphere">
			<li>Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god, 
			known for his speed</li>
